# numerocentral
Numero Central works similar as Google Voice (now  Hangouts).  It allows you to have your own Virtual PBX with no VoIP at the client side, it works with cellphones or land lines. You just need to havea T1/E1 connection. It has been in the Central American market for over a decade, improving its features month after month.
